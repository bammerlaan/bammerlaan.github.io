I recently wrote a [blog post about Mastodon](/posts/Mastodon-Nederland) (in Dutch). Originally, I wanted to include this information there as well, but it became a bit much. Besides, this lends itself well to a separate post.

I wanted to show how **I** use Mastodon, because it can be difficult to truly make such a new medium your own. It took me some time, in any case.

# Following Other Users

Once you've chosen a server (or *instance*, as Fediverse servers are sometimes called), you can get started. The first step is to follow interesting users, and [here you'll find a nice list](https://fedi.directory/tag/netherlands/) of Dutch users who are worthwhile. You can also [follow me](https://mastodon.nl/@bammerlaan), of course. I talk embarrassingly little about classical music (but just you wait, I have things planned!).

# Hashtags on Moshidon

But then: where it really gets interesting is the hashtags. I personally hardly ever look at my actual Home page; what I like is following **hashtags**. The Android app [Moshidon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android.moshinda&hl=en) works very nicely for this.

This is what Moshidon looks like when I open the app:

<figure class="br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 mw5">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Homepagina_Mosh.png">
    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Homepagina_Mosh.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of the Moshidon (Mastodon) app's home timeline. The top post is from 'Asta she/her/they' and reads: 'I use PDF patterns rarely enough to always forget how much I hate putting them together in between. They're the worst. But then again so is copying patterns so I guess it's just patterns in general that are the worst! #sewing'. Below it is a post from 'Benita Skinner' that says 'Good morning ‚òï Say hello, if you're my neighbour... üëã ü•∞ Happy Stitching! ‚úÇÔ∏è üßµ ‚ù§Ô∏è #quilting #sewing'. This post includes a vintage image macro showing two women sewing, with the text: 'When working on a quilt, I'm in my own little world. You know where tha[t] you're my'." class="br3 br--top"></a>
    </figure>

Nice, it shows my tab with a collection of hashtags related to sewing. I find it a relaxing and creative hobby! *The Great British Sewing Bee* is totally my jam! Note that I don't see the regular home page. Maybe there are posts about the current state of affairs in the world there, *ugh*. I'm not always in the right mood for that.

If I **swipe** left or right, I switch tabs. If I press `‚òï Naaien ‚åÑ` in the top left, I get this list to manually select the tab:

<figure class="br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 mw5">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Taglijst_mosh.png">
    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Taglijst_mosh.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of the Moshidon (Mastodon) app showing the main menu open on the left side of the screen. The menu lists custom timelines, which appear to be based on tags or interests. The visible items are: Naaien, crafts, mastodon, Fedifollows, android, linux, Open source, askfedi, geocaching, buyitforlife, cats, typography, Home, Social media, Local, and Federation." class="br3 br--top"></a>
    I couldn't find a more suitable icon than ‚òï. Oh well.
</figure>

I have a lot of them, but that's okay. Usually I don't even use this menu but just swipe to the next tab when I'm done with it:

<figure class="br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 mw5">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/swiping_small.gif">
  	<img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/swiping_small.gif" alt="A short GIF showing a dark mode screen recording of the Moshidon (Mastodon) app on a mobile phone. The screen initially displays a custom timeline titled '‚òï Naaien' (Sewing). The user then swipes left to seamlessly transition to the next custom timeline, which is titled 'üßµ crafts'. The content of the new timeline changes instantly to show posts related to crafting." class="br3 br--top"></a>
  	<!--Deze drie tabs zijn voor de meeste klassieke musici wel voldoende.-->
</figure>

To create this, press `‚ãÆ` in the top left:

<figure class="br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 mw5">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/menu_moshidon.png">
    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/menu_moshidon.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of the Moshidon (Mastodon) app's home timeline with the main dropdown menu open at the top right. The visible menu options are: Settings, Announcements, Edit timelines, Your lists, and Hashtags you follow. The timeline content underneath shows posts related to sewing and quilting." class="br3 br--top"></a>
    
</figure>

Then on `Edit timelines`. You will then see a list like this, probably only with `Home`, `Local`, and `Federation`. Here you press `+`.

<figure class="br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 mw5">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Timelines_settings_moshi.png">
    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Timelines_settings_moshi.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of the 'Timelines' settings screen in the Moshidon (Mastodon) app. The screen lists all the user's custom timelines, including Naaien, crafts, mastodon, Fedifollows, android, linux, Open source, askfedi, geocaching, buyitforlife, cats, typography, and others scrolled off-screen. Each timeline name has a corresponding icon." class="br3 br--top"></a>
    
</figure>

Here you can set an icon (**1**) and the title of your tab (**2**). At **3** you enter the main *hashtag*, and at **4** you can add extra tags. Not at **5**, otherwise you will only see messages that have both the tag at **3** and the tag at **5**, and not just one of them. With **6** you can optionally filter out certain hashtags. For example, for my "Crafts" tab, I don't want to see things about sewing, because I've already seen those.

<figure class="br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 mw5">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Moshidon_edit_timline.png">
    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Moshidon_edit_timline.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of the 'Edit timeline' screen in the Moshidon (Mastodon) app for a custom timeline named 'crafts'. The screen shows advanced hashtag filtering options, which are: 'Posts containing hashtag... crafts', '...or any of these: prints, handmade, diy', '...and every one of these: Enter hashtags...', and '...but none of these: sewing'. A note at the bottom warns that the server handles these operations and combining them might not be supported." class="br3 br--top"></a>
    
</figure>

*Et voil√†*, you've added a tab!

For me, this is such an important feature that I actually can't use most other Mastodon apps, as many do not support this.

# Hashtags in the Browser

This is also possible on the computer, although in a slightly less elegant way, if you ask me:

<figure class="w-100-ns br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 center">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Mastodon_advanced.png">
    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Mastodon_advanced.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of a multi-column Mastodon (Fediverse) web interface, which looks similar to the Moshidon app, but is on a desktop. There are four columns visible: 1) The Composer/Search Column on the far left, showing the user is logged in as Sebastiaan Ammerlaan. 2) Notifications, which features posts about using Mastodon, finding good servers, and a Fediverse Tips post with a fox character. 3) #sewing or visiblemending, which shows a post about finishing a sewing project with a vintage machine and an image of a dark shirt, and a post by Dr Camilla Hoel with two images of clothing patterns/dresses. 4) mastodon or fediverse/fedifedi (partially cut off), which shows a post with Mastodon statistics and a post about BlueSky and the Fediverse that references a traffic diagram. 5) #askfedi on the far right, which includes a post asking about recommending a good VPN for Linux, and a post from Lydia Conwell discussing listening to good 'jazz' and hearing an unusual noise in the recording." class="br3 br--top"></a>
    
</figure>

This is the "**Advanced Web Interface**". If you click on `‚öôÔ∏è Settings` on the website, the checkbox to enable this is almost at the very top.

<figure class="w-100-ns br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 center">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Mastodon_settings_advanced.png">
    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Mastodon_settings_advanced.png" alt="A screenshot of a setting within a Mastodon web interface, displayed in dark mode and in Dutch. The section heading is 'GEAVANCEERDE WEBOMGEVING' (Advanced Web Interface). The explanatory text reads: 'Wanneer je van de hele schermbreedte wilt gebruik maken, stelt de geavanceerde webomgeving je in staat om meerdere verschillende kolommen te configureren. Hiermee kun je zo veel mogelijk informatie op hetzelfde moment bekijken, zoals: Start, meldingen, de globale tijdlijn, meerdere lijsten en hashtags.' (When you want to use the full screen width, the advanced web interface enables you to configure multiple different columns. With this, you can view as much information as possible at the same time, such as: Home, notifications, the global timeline, multiple lists and hashtags.) Below the text is a checked box with the label 'Geavanceerde webomgeving inschakelen' (Enable advanced web interface)." class="br3 br--top"></a>
    Enabling the Advanced Web Interface.

You then get a column overview. If you click on a hashtag, it opens a new column:

<figure class="br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 mw5">
<a href="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Mastodon_tag_pin.png">
    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/Mastodon_tag_pin.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of the #butterflies hashtag page within the Mastodon social network. At the top, there is an option to '+ Pin' the tag and a large purple button that says 'Follow hashtag'. Statistics show '29 posts - 29 participants - 4 posts today'. The first visible post is from Michael Ramsdell, sharing two photos of butterflies on a purple thistle flower: a Tiger Swallowtail and a Spicebush Swallowtail. The post text identifies them as 'Tiger & Spicebush Swallowtails (Papilio glaucus) - (Papilio Troilus) Butterflies 2025 37-38. Sharing is a virtue Uninspired by to many'. The second post is from Cambirdsong and contains an image of a yellow and black butterfly perched on a thistle, with the caption 'Morning light.'." class="br3 br--top"></a>

</svg> in the top right, the button to pin the column appears (with <code>+ Pin</code>). If you click on <code>Include addition tags for this column</code> in the newly created column, you'll see a similar menu to the one in Moshidon. </p>

Then you can horizontally scroll across a large page with all the hashtags:

<figure class="w-100-ns br3 ma1 ba b--light-gray caption tc f7 center">

    <img src="/images/blog/2025/Mastodon-hashtags/output.gif" alt="A GIF showing a desktop view of the Mastodon interface in dark mode, showing a few different timelines or columns. The GIF begins with a column titled 'Notifications' and then scrolls to show columns titled 'sewing or visiblemending', 'mastodon or fediverse/fedifedi', and 'askfedi'. The columns contain various text and image posts discussing topics like finishing a sewing project, a guide to Mastodon, statistics on Mastodon users, and a post titled 'About BlueSky/BlueSky's traffic flows from servers to corporate-owned relays and The Fediverse's traffic flows directly between cheap-to-run servers'. The GIF demonstrates the customizability and multi-column view of the platform." class="br3 br--top"></a>
    <br>(Tip: Hold down Shift and scroll with the mouse wheel to scroll horizontally!)
</figure>

I would have preferred a menu with these kinds of hashtag collections, like in Moshidon, but hey, this works too.

Hopefully, this helped!
