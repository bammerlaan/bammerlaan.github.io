One of the pieces I performed during my final exam at the Utrecht Conservatory was <i>Cuerpo de Mujer</i> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Mich%C3%A1ns">Carlos Micháns</a>. The song is part of his lieder bundle <i>Cinco Canciones de Amor</i> (1988) on text by Pablo Neruda. The composer enjoyed my performance enough to publish it on his own Youtube channel, and can be found below:<br><br>

Piano: Carl van Reenen.<br><br>

Exciting and exuberant music—I hope to be able to perform the rest of the bundle soon.
