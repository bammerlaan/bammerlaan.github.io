After my participation to NKK NXT, the talent development programme of the [Netherlands Chamber Choir](https://www.nederlandskamerkoor.nl), our group decided to continue on together. We picked the name *Immix*, old English for mixture / to mix. The group became quite close during the project and I am happy to have the opportunity to continue making music with them.

I made a new website for the ensemble, which can be found at [https://immixvocalensemble.com](https://immixvocalensemble.com). It is fully open source, so the source code can be looked at and used for making another website. This fits our young idealism.
