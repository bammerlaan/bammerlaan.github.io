Sebastiaan (Bas) Ammerlaan begged his parents for violin lessons when he was four. Ever since, music took a strong hold of him. He started singing when he joined the [University College Roosevelt](https://www.ucr.nl) university choir as part of his minor in viola playing. He also studied musicology there. From 2013 on he studied classical singing at the [HKU Utrecht Conservatory](https://www.hku.nl/en/study-at-hku/utrechts-conservatorium), first with [Jón Þorsteinsson](https://www.jonthorsteinsson.com) and from 2016–2020 with [Selma Harkink](http://www.selmaharkink.com). 

In 2023, he graduated from the [Royal Conservatoire](https://www.koncon.nl) in The Hague with lessons from [Gerda van Zelm](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/gerdavanzelm) and [Harry van Berne](https://www.koxvocaal.nl/vocalist/harry-van-berne). He also received lessons from [David Wilson-Johnson](https://davidwilsonjohnson.eu), [Jasper Schweppe](https://www.jasperschweppe.nl/), [Irene Verburg](http://www.ireneverburg.nl), [Kaspar Kröner](http://kasparkroener.weebly.com/), [Marjan Kuiper](http://www.marjankuiper.nl) and [Elisabeth Blom](https://www.elisabethblom.nl).

He is a strong proponent of performing newly written music. He has been fortunate enough to be able to give (solo) premières of music by several big composers, like [David Lang](https://davidlangmusic.com/), [Daan Manneke](https://www.daanmanneke.nl/), [Joey Roukens](https://joeyroukens.com/) and [Mathilde Wantenaar](https://donemus.nl/composer/mathilde-wantenaar/). 

Sebastiaan has performed with the [Huelgas Ensemble](https://www.huelgasensemble.be/), the [Netherlands Chamber Choir](https://www.nederlandskamerkoor.nl/), the [choir of the Dutch National Opera](https://www.operaballet.nl/koor-van-de-nationale-opera-0), [Consensus Vocalis](https://consensusvocalis.nl/) and the [Bach Choir of the Netherlands](https://beleefklassiek.nl/The-Bach-Choir-Orchestra-of-the-Netherlands). He played in the [Dutch National Youth Orchestra](https://www.jeugdorkest.nl) and sang in the [Dutch National Youth Choir](http://www.nationalekoren.nl/)

He forms a duo with pianist [Geert Omta](https://www.geertomta.nl/). They organise their own concerts and provide musical embellishment to events like weddings and funerals.
